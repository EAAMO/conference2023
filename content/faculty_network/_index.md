The EAAMO community aims to bridge the gap between research and practitioners by fostering meaningful collaborations between academics, nonprofit organizations, and policy-makers. Through the Faculty Network, we aim to create a community that advances our goals:
- recruit a diverse group of students interested in this work, 
- synergistically advance both basic research and translational work, and 
- find researcher and practitioner collaborators.

Having that in mind, the goal of the Faculty Network event is to **meet, discuss, and share best practices for such challenges**.

Over the past year, Faculty Network chairs have been working on this goals. At EAAMO'23, we aim to get together as a community and collectively unravel the best strategies to surmount these shared obstacles.

*More information about the Faculty Network event at EAAMO'23 will be available at this page.*
