The first day of EAAMO 2023 will feature a doctoral consortium for students who have interests relevant to the conference. The event will allow students to meet other students in the field, learn about related career paths, have an opportunity to present their work, participate in dedicated skills sessions, and have meetings with faculty mentors. Depending on funding availability, some travel support may be available. While primarily targeted at PhD students, the DC is open as well to undergraduate and masters students. Content will be primarily designed for students in computer science, operations research, and economics programs, but students from all fields are welcome to apply.

**Application**: to apply for the DC, fill out the form at the following [link](https://forms.gle/XLV6dh5vhXjeZVTU7). Students who are requesting travel funding should also fill out the form that can be found at [financial assistance dedicated page](https://eaamo.org/financial_assistance/).

**Deadline**: Applications for the DC and for travel funding must be received by **August 10, 2023**.

**Co-chairs**: [Miri Zilka](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/mz477) (University of Cambridge), [Juba Ziani](http://juba-ziani.com/) (Georgia Institute of Technology)
