## Conference Highlights 

### Research collaboration with Indigenous communities from Mexico 

For a second year in a row, EAAMO showcased the results of the **Summer of Science Program** , which consisted of research projects conducted by Indigenous women from Mexico. **The Summer of Science Program** is a collaborative effort between the Mechanism Design for Social Good (<a href="https://www.md4sg.com/">MD4SG</a>) research initiative and the National Network of Councils and State Organizations of Science and Technology (REDNACECYT), and is dedicated to empowering female students from Indigenous communities in Mexico. The program provided the students, who are enrolled at various postgraduate education levels, with the opportunity to design and implement research projects that centered their local communities.

This year, the Summer of Science Program has expanded its reach, welcoming **a total of 17 female students from various states in Mexico**, including Michoacán, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Estado de México, Veracruz, Puebla, and San Luis Potosí. These students **represent 11 indigenous communities**, encompassing Cuanajo, Purépecha, Mixteco, Tepehuan, Rarámuri, Mazahua, Zapoteca, Náhuatl, Tének, Mazateca, and Zoque. The projects proposed by the students span a wide array of topics, ranging from improving collective decision-making in indigenous communities to preserving indigenous culture and identity, providing equitable healthcare and housing, and studying local indigenous communities' perceptions of environmental policies. This initiative underscores the commitment to fostering diversity, inclusion, and the application of knowledge to drive positive change in indigenous communities throughout Mexico.

These students were paired with mentors from MD4SG who guided them through their projects during the summer. The culmination of this collaboration was a poster session during the conference.
